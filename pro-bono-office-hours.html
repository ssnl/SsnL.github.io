## Pro Bono Office Hours
{: style="font-size:1.2em;margin-top:0.1em"}

Inspired by [Wei-Chiu Ma](https://people.csail.mit.edu/weichium/), I commit 1-2 hours per week to provide suggestions and/or mentorships to students from underrepresented groups or whoever is in need.

Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/pvrLmmrMkqAhApCC6) if you are interested. Priorities will be given to underrepresented groups and career-focused topics.
